Hey!
Thank you for downloading our map!

Recommendations:
*enable command blocks
*disable monsters
*disable fire spread (/gamerule doFireTick false)
*play in adventure mode 
*That crappy zipline works only in creative mode but if I were you I would not use it x)
*Starting coordinates(x,y,z): -239 97 -14
*Have fun!
